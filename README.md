# hello-world
# This is my first repository. Its nothing fancy. I'm just dipping my toes in the github pool. 

 I am a college student taking a course on Node.js this semester. Github will be essential to the coursework. That being said, I will be  adding a lot of programs and topics relevant to JavaScript and Node.js. I will also be adding HTML and CSS coursework for another class when that begins in March.
